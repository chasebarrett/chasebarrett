# Hi, I'm Chase Barrett 👋  
**PMP® certified Project Manager | eCommerce Systems Specialist | Operations & Automation Builder**

I’m a systems thinker who loves untangling complexity, improving operational workflows, and building scalable digital infrastructure. My background blends eCommerce, project management, automation, Agile project leadership, and technical problem-solving across platforms like Shopify, Magento, NetSuite, Akeneo PIM, Celigo, GA4, and Klaviyo.

I focus on turning fragmented processes into clean, reliable systems that teams can trust and businesses can scale on.

I’ve also led and managed teams with direct reports, with a strong focus on mentorship, clarity, and professional development. I believe helping others grow — professionally and personally — is one of the most meaningful responsibilities of leadership.

## 🧭 What I Do
- **eCommerce Systems Optimization** (Shopify, Magento, NetSuite, Celigo)  
- **Process Automation & Integration Workflows**  
- **Agile & Hybrid Project Management (PMP®)**  
- **Product Data Governance & Quality Gate Design**  
- **SEO & AI-Search Content Architecture**  
- **Python & SQL for analysis, automation, and internal tooling**

I care deeply about clarity, reliability, and removing friction from both user experiences and internal operations.

## 🧪 Currently Exploring
- Practical ways to embed AI into day-to-day eCommerce operations (content, merchandising, support, and internal workflows)
- Structuring SEO and product data to be more interpretable, retrievable, and useful for AI-driven search and discovery
- Designing custom GPTs and prompt frameworks to create repeatable business value (content systems, QA checks, decision support)
- Using AI as a force multiplier for small teams: automation, documentation, and faster iteration without added headcount
- Deeper integration of AI within project management tooling (planning, risk tracking, reporting, and stakeholder communication)
- Governance, guardrails, and quality control for AI-assisted workflows in production environments
